# insp_fixer
Fixes Damaged INSP Files

What Does it Do?
My SDcard failed while transferring my Insta360 insp files (3D photos) from their proprietary format

Requirements:
python
pip
Pillow
tq

Features:

Separate functions for processing single files and directories
Modified command-line interface to accept either a file or directory as input
Improved progress reporting for single file processing
Made validation messages clearer
Added better path handling to avoid copying files over themselves

You can now use the script in either mode:
For a single file:
python insp_convert.py path/to/image.jpg output_directory/ path/to/template.insp -v

For a directory:
python insp_convert.py path/to/input_directory/ output_directory/ path/to/template.insp -v
